# Overview

## Purpose

Tableau is an application that allows us to visualize our data so that it is easier for our audience to understand. We are using Tableau to present our business proposal for a bike sharing company. NYC Citibike provides a service to locals and tourists to rent bikes to ride around New York City, but we would like to see how they are utilized and by who.

## Results

Here is what we have discovered in the visualization of our data:

<b>August Peak Hours: </b>
During the month of August the highest peak usage time for consumers was during 8am and 5pm - 7pm. This could be that local consumers would ride to and from work or tourists would tour the city when the weather was more favorable.

<b>Checkout Times for Users: </b>
The typical checkout time for a consumer was approximately 5 mins long. This quick turnaround time means that consumers are utilizing bikes for shorter distances within the city especially during the early hours of the morning. If you were to look at the checkout times in the afternoon, they are typically longer as there is more traffic to get through in the city.

<b>Gender Breakdown of Users: </b>
Males are more inclined to rent city bikes versus women. This information could be used to market more towards women to bring in more female users.

<b>Checkout Times based on Gender: </b>
This validates the above pie chart as males are the dominant users of Citibikes

<b>Trips for Users: </b>
This also validates the peak hours of 8am, 5pm - 7pm. The below heatmap shows this as the blocks are deeper in color during the weekdays, but the hours vary during the weekend.

<b>Trips based by Gender: </b>
The peak times are similar for all genders, but usage is dominated once again by males.

<b>Types of Users by Gender: </b>
We have two different types of users, customers or subscribers. Customers are typically tourists who are using the service for a shorter period of time. Subscribers are most likely locals who use the service to get to and from work, or for leisure time around the city. As we can see, the most popular field is male subscribers that utilize the service most heavily any day of the week.

## Summary

The results that we see above can be used to enhance NYC Citibikes marketing. Most users are males and are subscribers. They could try to focus on bringing in more female consumers to expand their base and increase their sales. Maybe they can introduce a loyalty program that would reward their customers or subscribers to increase retention as well. 

I would like to see how rides vary by age by weekday. I also would like to visualize how rides vary by month as I'm sure that there is a higher usership in warmer months versus colder ones.
